"""
MiniVenmo! Imagine that your phone and wallet are trying to have a beautiful
baby. In order to make this happen, you must write a social payment app.
Implement a program that will feature users, credit cards, and payment feeds.
"""

"""
Questions:
 
    1. Complete the `MiniVenmo.create_user()` method to allow our application to create new users.

    2. Complete the `User.pay()` method to allow users to pay each other. Consider the following: if user A is paying user B, user's A balance should be used if there's enough balance to cover the whole payment, if not, user's A credit card should be charged instead.

    3. Venmo has the Feed functionality, that shows the payments that users have been doing in the app. If Bobby paid Carol $5, and then Carol paid Bobby $15, it should look something like this
   

    Bobby paid Carol $5.00 for Coffee
    Carol paid Bobby $15.00 for Lunch

    Implement the `User.retrieve_activity()` and `MiniVenmo.render_feed()` methods so the MiniVenmo application can render the feed.

    4. Now users should be able to add friends. Implement the `User.add_friend()` method to allow users to add friends.
    5. Now modify the methods involved in rendering the feed to also show when user's added each other as friends.

"""

Running
- Show feed output (no tests): `python -c "from main import MiniVenmo; MiniVenmo.run()"`
- Run all tests: `python -m unittest discover -s tests`
- Run a single test: `python -m unittest tests.test_feed.TestFeed.test_render_feed_matches_readme_example`

Project structure
- `main.py`: MiniVenmo + entrypoint/test harness.
- `venmo.py`: Payment, Friendship, User.
- `exceptions.py`: custom exceptions.
- `tests/`: unit tests (with `tests/__init__.py` for direct module runs).
